      <p>Woodcoin is a public digital currency which uses Pure Skein. Its unit of exchange is LOG. It is similar to other cryptocurrencies, but has key differences. Woodcoin was invented by Funkenstein the Dwarf in October 2014. Old site <a href="http://archive.woodcoin.org">here</a>.  <a href="http://archive.woodcoin.org/index.php/category/chinese/">中文</a></p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
      <li>Woodcoin&rsquo;s harmonic distribution is designed to more closely model renewable resources than nonrenewable ones. This means that while it is always better to chop LOGs today, there will still be incentive to chop tomorrow.</li>
      <li>The logarithmic money supply curve is designed for stability and longevity,  with the longest reward schedule of any other cryptocurrency.</li>
      <li>It also features novel coin design in proof of work function (Pure Skein) and in digital signature keypairs (X9_62_prime256v1).</li>
      </ul>
